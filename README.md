# [Signimpact - Impact tracker]

How can you track your NGO's impact? Go no further, we have a solution for you! The application is intended for use in the management of non-profit organizations and allows you to create a profile and set criteria for evaluating ongoing events and projects. It also helps create feedback forms to interact with volunteers and project managers to collect information and conduct further analysis. Our User-friendly dashboard allows you to track your progress.

This project was created during hack'n lead 2023 by the Stars++ team. 

## Backend installation

1. Make sure you have Python>=3.8 installed
2. If you do not want to install packages globally create a virtual environment with `python3 -m venv venv` and source it: `source venv/bin/activate`
3. Change directory: `cd backend/`
4. Pip install the requirements: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
5. To run the server: `python main.py`
